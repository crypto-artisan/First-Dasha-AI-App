# How to start the demo app

This is the demo app that was the result of the process described in the blog. I'm sharing this app, so that you can compare with what you built using the instructions.


2. Create or log into your account using the Dasha CLI tool:

```sh
npx dasha account login
```

3. To start a text chat, run:

```sh
npm start chat
```

4. To receive a phone call from Dasha, run:

```sh
npm start <your phone number>
```

The phone number should be in the international format without the `+` (e.g. `12223334455`)
